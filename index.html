				<h3>About Lovelace</h3>
				<p>Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>'s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.</p>
